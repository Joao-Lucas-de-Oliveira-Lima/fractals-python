# Fractals with Python
This project is a challenge to practice recursive algorithms in the **Data Structures** course. It reimplements an earlier version I developed in **C++** using the **SFML 2.5.1** library, now adapted for **Python** with the `turtle` library.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (Version 3.6 or higher)

## Running the Code
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Run a script with the following command:
```bash
python -u fractals/<script_name>.py
```
>Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the script you want to run (e.g., `binary_tree.py` or `squares.py`).
## Visual Examples
